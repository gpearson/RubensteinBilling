*****************

I initially developed this subscription/recurring billing system around the time ColdFusion MX 6 was released. So please forgive some of the architecture choices and poor coding practices!

The Billing System runs on Windows and Linux, SQL Server (2005+) and MySQL (4.1+). It should run on Railo and OpenBD in addition to ColdFusion (v7+).

There is a lot of documentation available, including installation instructions. You will need them. There are even some screen shots and tours.

You can check them out at www.strubenstein.com .

If you find any bugs or have questions, please contact me:

I am available for consulting, including customization of the billing system and other projects. 

I am also working on launching Agreedis.org, a community engagement platform designed to foster compromise solutions to today's major problems. (It's my way of trying to solve all of the world's problems without having to run for President.)
