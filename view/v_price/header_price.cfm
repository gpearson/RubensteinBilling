Pricing options not created within a particular category or product automatically apply to <i>all</i> products or the entire invoice. For prices that apply only to a category or product, please manage them via that category or product instead. This does <i>not</i> mean that the price applies to all customers though. You can still designate which companies, groups or users are targets for this price.
